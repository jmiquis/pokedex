# ✌️ue.js Project
Bachelors Degree's Advanced web programming subject final project.
The vue app retrieves info from an API using Axios and Pinia🍍 as a parameters store.
It is a pokedex app which includes a login and a filtred search.
It has been very interesting getting into
a JS framework.
We can say I have VUEwed it propperly...can't we?
