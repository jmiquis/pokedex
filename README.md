# ✌️ue.js Project
Bachelors Degree's Advanced web programming subject final project.
The vue app retrieves info from an API using Axios and Pinia🍍 as a parameters store.
Vue hasn't been my cup of tea but I have to say that is been very interesting getting into
a JS framework at last.
We can say I have viewed it propperly...can't we?
